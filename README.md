## API

This package provides two functions: `triggerWorkflow` and `waitForCompletion`.

### triggerWorkflow

Triggers a GitHub Actions workflow and returns the `run_id` of the triggered workflow.

**Example**

```ts
import { triggerWorkflow } from 'trigger-workflow';

async function main() {
  const run_id = await triggerWorkflow({
    owner: 'foo',
    repo: 'bar',
    token: 'ghp_your_github_token_here',
    workflow_id: 'my-workflow.yml',
    ref: 'main'
  });

  console.log(`Workflow triggered with run_id: ${run_id}`);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### waitForCompletion

Waits for a GitHub Actions workflow to complete, polling at a specified interval.

**Example**

```ts
import { triggerWorkflow, waitForCompletion } from 'trigger-workflow';

async function main() {
  const token = 'ghp_your_github_token_here';
  const run_id = '1234567890';
  const owner = 'foo';
  const repo = 'bar';

  await waitForCompletion({
    owner,
    repo,
    token,
    run_id,
    interval: 5000,
  });

  console.log('Workflow completed!');
}

main().catch(console.error);
```
